# Shopping Cart

This is a project I'm working on to learn more about PHP and the CakePHP framework. 
A shopping cart utilizes a many-to-many backend scheme between between Products and Orders, which is a relationship I had never implemented before.
I'm still working on fleshing out the application more so it can pass as a website for a fake retail company, however the main goal of the project was to have a working backend for checking out orders, and any other functionality is icing on the cake.
