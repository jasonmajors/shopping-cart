# Shopping Cart

This is a project I'm working on to learn more about PHP and the CakePHP framework. This is web application for a fictional online retail company, "Majors' Outdoor Emporium". The main goal of this project was to create a functional shopping cart, where a user can add products to their cart, view their cart, checkout, and view their past orders.

I'm still working on fleshing out the application/making it look pretty so it can pass as a website for a fake retail company, however the main focus of the project was creating the working shopping cart backend, and any other functionality is icing on the cake.

Register a user and create some orders, or use login: jdoe@fake.com/password01
